# List of issues to fix

* do not use green, these are not found in sunrises or sunsets
* some of the yellow colors looked green, careful to avoid that
* Transitions are noticable if the start and end times are compressed for testing, start and end range should factor in when determining granularity of changes, to ensure they are not noticeable
* Lock out switch was not turned off at the end of the sunrise sequence, this should be turned on at the beginning of every sequence and turned off at the end.
* Allow debug output controls so I can see exactly what the app is doing.
