# List of issues to fix


* "Hub variable for final level" pulldown is not populated with anything. It should contain a list of hub variables that are numeric. As a result this warning occurs: [SunriseSunset] Sunrise skipped (missing target level)
* Scheduled a sunrise for 10:05 AM and at that time, the app just reported: [SunriseSunset] Sunrise scheduled for Nov 12 10:05 AM and did nothing. Probably because it didn't have a target level.
